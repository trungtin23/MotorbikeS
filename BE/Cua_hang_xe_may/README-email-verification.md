# Email Verification Flow Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a proper HTML response to the email verification process. When a user clicks on the verification link in their email, they will now see a nicely formatted HTML page confirming their successful verification, instead of a JSON response.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified the `/api/auth/verify` Endpoint
- Changed the endpoint to return HTML content instead of JSON
- Added a success page with:
  - Success message in Vietnamese
  - A button to navigate to the login page
  - Automatic redirect to the login page after 5 seconds
- Added an error page for invalid verification codes

### 2. Updated the Email Service
- Translated the email content to Vietnamese
- Styled the verification button to match the application's color scheme

## How to Test

1. **Register a new account**
   - Go to the registration page
   - Fill in the required information and submit
   - You should receive a verification email

2. **Verify the email**
   - Open the verification email
   - Click on the "Xác thực Email" button or copy the verification link
   - You should see a success page with:
     - A green checkmark icon
     - A message confirming successful verification
     - A button to navigate to the login page
     - A countdown timer for automatic redirect

3. **Test invalid verification**
   - Try accessing the verification endpoint with an invalid code:
     - `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/verify?code=invalid-code`
   - You should see an error page with:
     - A red X icon
     - A message indicating the verification code is invalid
     - A button to return to the login page

## Notes for Developers
- The HTML content is generated directly in the controller for simplicity
- In a production environment, consider moving the HTML templates to separate files
- The frontend URL is hardcoded as `http://localhost:3000/login` - update this if your frontend is hosted elsewhere
